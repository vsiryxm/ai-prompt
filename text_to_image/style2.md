Bright pops of primary colors — red, yellow, and blue — intersect with monochrome elements, creating strong visual contrast. Cut-out stars, clouds, and butterflies are scattered throughout, adding a whimsical tone.

Some text elements in mismatched fonts are collaged into the image, like hand-cut ransom letters or vintage advertisements. The entire composition has a slightly weathered, analog texture, mimicking the feel of handmade physical collages.
